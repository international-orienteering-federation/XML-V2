# IOF Data Standard, version 2.0.3

This is the first standard that will be widely implemented by software developers including the two EKT system, Emit and Sport Ident.

The standard is a total rewrite as a result of the experiences gained in the Swedish OLA Project and the development of Condes. Also major input have been made by Emit and Sport Ident developers.

The changes from version 1.0 includes:

* A total rewrite of nearly all elements.
* Instead of having several Document Type Declaration (DTD) files each holding a small part of the standard and depending on each other the DTD is now assembled in a single file.
* A number of messages, i.e. specification of the lists to be send from one software element to another, have been made. There still are some messages missing and they will be developed concurrently with demand for them.
* Some example files of the messages to exchange have been made.
Please read the comments in the DTD file for further information.
